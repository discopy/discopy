"""
The compact closed category of bidirectional neural networks, with additive
dimensions as objects and concatenation as tensor.

A :class:`Network` with domain ``Dim(a_1, ..., a_m)`` and codomain
``Dim(b_1, ..., b_n)`` carries one :class:`torch.nn.Module` from ``R ** w``
to ``R ** w`` for ``w = a_1 + ... + a_m + b_1 + ... + b_n``, reading incoming
messages on all its ports and emitting outgoing messages on all its ports.
Networks compose with the cartesian product of vector spaces, so the tensor
of dimensions is their sum with the zero-dimensional space ``Dim(0)`` as
unit; dimensions are self-dual so that cups, caps and swaps are pure
rerouting.

The combinatorial maps of this category are graph neural networks: the
:meth:`CMap.forward` pass does synchronous message passing along the wires,
which implements the execution formula of the geometry of interaction, see
:cite:t:`Abramsky96` and :mod:`discopy.interaction` for the Int-construction
of Joyal, Street & Verity :cite:p:`JoyalEtAl96`.

Note that ``import discopy.neural`` does not import ``torch``: networks can
be built, composed and rewired without it, only evaluating their modules
requires it.

Example
-------

Message passing on the combinatorial map of a diagram computes its image
under the execution formula, e.g. rerouting for a snake:

>>> import torch
>>> snake = Id(Dim(2)).transpose().to_map()
>>> snake.boxes
()
>>> x = torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.2]])
>>> assert (snake(x) == x).all()

    A network is a neural box together with a torch module computing it.

    The module maps ``R ** width`` to ``R ** width`` for ``width`` the sum
    of the domain and codomain dimensions, reading one incoming message and
    emitting one outgoing message on every port, in the order given by the
    domain followed by the codomain. Reusing the same network instance, or
    the same module, as several boxes shares its weights.

    Cups, caps and swaps are networks with ``module`` left to ``None``,
    since they are pure rerouting.

    Parameters:
        name : The name of the network.
        dom : The domain of the network, i.e. its input.

    Note
    ----
    Networks compare equal when they have the same name, shape and module,
    where missing modules compare equal and given modules compare by
    identity. The dagger and rotation of a network reuse its module, with
    the weights read in the new port order.
