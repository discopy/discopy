    "The free category with bubbles can be defined by induction over the level of nesting, i.e. an $(n + 1)$-nested bubble is a box which takes an arrow with $n$-nested bubbles as argument.\n",

    "Formulae are evaluated by applying a functor into the category of finite sets and binary relations, which is equivalent to Boolean matrices.\n",

    "#### Abstract definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We can finally get to our definition of diagrams: they are **arrows in a free monoidal category**.\n",
    "Let's spell this out.\n",
    "We have a category $\\mathbf{MonCat}$ with monoidal categories as objects and monoidal functors as arrows, i.e. functors which respect the tensor.\n",
    "Similarly, $\\mathbf{MonSig}$ is the category of monoidal signatures and homomorphisms between them.\n",
    "And again, we have a forgetful functor $U : \\mathbf{MonCat} \\to \\mathbf{MonSig}$.\n",
    "(This is where we need to assume our monoidal categories are in fact coloured PROs).\n",
    "We want to construct its left-adjoint, i.e. the functor $F : \\mathbf{MonSig} \\to \\mathbf{MonCat}$ which sends a monoidal signature $G$ to the free monoidal category $\\mathbf{C}_G$ with a natural isomorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{MonCat}(\\mathbf{C}_G, \\mathbf{D}) \\simeq \\mathbf{MonSig}(G, U_\\mathbf{D})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know some abstract algebra, then you know the brute force way to implement such a beast.\n",
    "First, we give a recursive definition of all the string diagrams:\n",
    "\n",
    "* every box $f : x \\to y \\in G$ is also a diagram $f : x \\to y \\in \\mathbf{C}_G$,\n",
    "* for every type $x \\in G_0^\\star$, the **identity** $1_x : x \\to x$ is a diagram drawn as a bunch of parallel wires,\n",
    "* for every composable pair of diagrams $f : x \\to y$ and $g : y \\to z$, their **composition** $f g : x \\to z$ is a diagram drawn as vertical concatenation,\n",
    "* for every pair of diagrams $f : x \\to y$ and $f' : x' \\to y'$, their **tensor** $f \\otimes f' : xx' \\to yy'$ is diagram drawn as horizontal juxtaposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we realise that some diagrams appear multiple times, e.g. $f (g h)$ and $(f g) h$, so that we need to take a **quotient**, i.e. putting two formulae in the same **equivalence class** if they represent the same diagram.\n",
    "Again, this equivalence relation is defined recursively: if $f \\sim f'$ and $g \\sim g'$ then $(f g) \\sim (f' g')$ and $(f \\otimes g) \\sim (f' \\otimes g')$.\n",
    "The base case is given by the axioms of monoidal categories, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **associativity**: $f (g h) \\sim (f g) h$ and $f \\otimes (f' \\otimes f'') \\sim (f \\otimes f') \\otimes f''$\n",
    "* **unit**: $(1_x f) \\sim f \\sim (f 1_y)$ and $(1 \\otimes f) \\sim f \\sim (f \\otimes 1)$\n",
    "* **interchange:** $(1_x \\otimes 1_y) \\sim 1_{xy}$ and $(f g) \\otimes (f' g') \\sim (f \\otimes f') (g \\otimes g')$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Layers and whiskering\n",
    "\n",
    "While the first two are straightforward, the third axiom corresponds to the tensor being a bifunctor: a) the tensor of identity is the identity of tensor and b) the tensor of a pair of compositions is the composition of a pair of tensors.\n",
    "This second part is the most challenging to implement.\n",
    "Indeed, remember how we got the associativity and unit of sequential composition to hold for free from that of Python tuples.\n",
    "We could try to play the same trick for the associativity and unit of parallel composition, but the interchange axiom forces these two types of tuples to distribute over one another.\n",
    "In fact, we can use interchange to write every diagram in **generic form**, i.e. as a composition of tensors.\n",
    "Furthermore, we can always write it so that every tensor expression contains exactly one box, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f \\otimes f' = (f 1_y) \\otimes (1_{x'} f') = (f \\otimes 1_{x'}) (1_y \\otimes f')$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a tensor expression is called a **layer**, it takes the form $1_a \\otimes f \\otimes 1_b$ for some box $f$ in the middle and a pair of (possibly empty) types $a$ and $b$ on the left and right.\n",
    "This is implemented by `Layer`, a subclass of `cat.Box` with three attributes `left: Ty`, `box: monoidal.Box` and `right: Ty`.\n",
    "We can tensor a layer by a type on its left or right, this is called **whiskering**."
