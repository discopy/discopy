# Blogs

Here are some recommended blogs about DisCoPy and applications of string diagrams in general.

## Quantum natural language processing

These two blog posts introduce QNLP with DisCoPy and [lambeq](https://github.com/CQCL/lambeq).

* ["We did it! On an actual quantum computer!"](https://medium.com/cambridge-quantum-computing/quantum-natural-language-processing-748d6f27b31d)
* [Now you can try it yourself with lambeq](https://medium.com/cambridge-quantum-computing/quantum-natural-language-processing-ii-6b6a44b319b2)

## Graphical linear algebra

This blog by [Pawel Sobocinski](https://www.ioc.ee/~pawel/) is what got us hooked to string diagrams.

## Monads and comonads

Dan Marsden writing about applications of string diagrams to monads, comonads and theoretical computer science.

## Azimuth

[John Baez](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/)'s blog is a great place to learn about string diagrams and category theory.
