So excited to have you here! If you want any guidance whatsoever, don't hesitate to reach out on [Discord](https://discopy.org/discord)!

## Run the tests

The first step is clone DisCoPy and install it locally.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/discopy/discopy.git
cd discopy
pip install .
```

Then you should check you haven't broken anything by running the test suite:

```shell
pip install ".[test]"
pycodestyle discopy
coverage run --source=discopy -m pytest --doctest-modules
coverage report -m
```

You should also check that the notebooks work fine:

```shell
pip install nbmake
pytest --nbmake docs/notebooks/*.ipynb
```

## Build the docs

You can build the documentation locally with [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/):

```shell
pip install ".[docs]" .
sphinx-build docs docs/_build/html
```

## Release a version

New versions (tag with 'X.X.X') of the package are released on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/discopy/) using `twine`:

```shell
git tag 'X.X.X'
python -m build
pip install twine
twine upload dist/*
```
