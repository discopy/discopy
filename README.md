DisCoPy is a Python toolkit for computing with [string diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram).

* **Organisation:** <https://discopy.org>
* **Documentation:** <https://docs.discopy.org>
* **Source code:** <https://github.com/discopy/discopy>

## Example: Cooking

This example is inspired from Pawel Sobocinski's blog post [Crema di Mascarpone and Diagrammatic Reasoning](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/05/06/crema-di-mascarpone-rules-of-the-game-part-2-and-diagrammatic-reasoning/).

```python
from discopy.symmetric import Ty, Box, Diagram

egg, white, yolk = Ty("egg"), Ty("white"), Ty("yolk")
crack = Box("crack", egg, white @ yolk)
merge = lambda X: Box("merge", X @ X, X)

# DisCoPy allows string diagrams to be defined as Python functions

@Diagram.from_callable(egg @ egg, white @ yolk)
def crack_two_eggs(x, y):
    (a, b), (c, d) = crack(x), crack(y)
    return (merge(white)(a, c), merge(yolk)(b, d))

# ... or in point-free style using parallel (@) and sequential (>>) composition

assert crack_two_eggs == crack @ crack\
  >> white @ Diagram.swap(yolk, white) @ yolk\
  >> merge(white) @ merge(yolk)

crack_two_eggs.draw()
```

![crack_two_eggs.draw()](https://github.com/discopy/discopy/raw/interaction-readme/test/drawing/imgs/crack-eggs.png)

By default, DisCoPy diagrams are made of layers with exactly one box in between some (possibly empty) list of wires on its left- and right-hand side.
In more abstract terms, they are arrows in a free [premonoidal category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premonoidal_category) where the tensor product is biased to the left, i.e.

```python
f @ g = f @ g.dom >> f.cod @ g != f.dom @ g >> f @ g.cod
```

We can get more general diagrams by specifying the list of layers `inside` manually or by calling the method [`Diagram.foliation`](https://docs.discopy.org/en/main/_api/discopy.monoidal.Diagram.html#discopy.monoidal.Diagram.foliation).

```python
from discopy.monoidal import Layer

crack_two_eggs_at_once = crack_two_eggs.foliation()

assert crack_two_eggs_at_once == Diagram(
  dom=egg @ egg, cod=white @ yolk, inside=(
    Layer(Ty(), crack, Ty(), crack, Ty()),
    Layer(white, Diagram.swap(yolk, white), yolk),
    Layer(Ty(), merge(white), Ty(), merge(yolk), Ty())))

crack_two_eggs_at_once.draw()
```

![crack_two_eggs_at_once.draw()](https://github.com/discopy/discopy/raw/interaction-readme/test/drawing/imgs/crack-two-eggs-at-once.png)

## Example: Alice loves Bob

### Snakes & Sentences

Wires can be bent using two special kinds of boxes: **cups** and **caps**, which satisfy the [snake equations](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/triangle+identities).

```python
from discopy.drawing import Equation
from discopy.rigid import Ty, Id, Cup, Cap

x = Ty('x')
left_snake = x @ Cap(x.r, x) >> Cup(x, x.r) @ x
right_snake =  Cap(x, x.l) @ x >> x @ Cup(x.l, x)
assert left_snake.normal_form() == Id(x) == right_snake.normal_form()

Equation(left_snake, Id(x), right_snake).draw()
```

![Equation(left_snake, Id(x), right_snake).draw()](https://github.com/discopy/discopy/raw/interaction-readme/test/drawing/imgs/typed-snake-equation.png)

In particular, DisCoPy can draw the grammatical structure of natural language sentences encoded as reductions in a [pregroup grammar](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pregroup+grammar).
See Lambek, [From Word To Sentence (2008)](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/lambek/pdffiles/2008lambek.pdf) for an introduction.

```python
from discopy.grammar.pregroup import Ty, Word, Cup

s, n = Ty('s'), Ty('n')  # sentence and noun
Alice, Bob = Word('Alice', n), Word('Bob', n)
loves = Word('loves', n.r @ s @ n.l)

sentence = Alice @ loves @ Bob >> Cup(n, n.r) @ s @ Cup(n.l, n)
sentence.foliation().draw()
```

![Alice loves Bob](https://github.com/discopy/discopy/raw/interaction-readme/test/drawing/imgs/alice-loves-bob.png)

Many other grammatical frameworks can be encoded as diagrams, e.g. [`cfg`](https://docs.discopy.org/en/main/_api/discopy.grammar.cfg.html) (context-free), [`categorial`](https://docs.discopy.org/en/main/_api/discopy.grammar.categorial.html) and [`dependency`](https://docs.discopy.org/en/main/_api/discopy.grammar.dependency.html) grammars.

### Functors & Rewrites

**Monoidal functors** compute the meaning of a diagram, given an interpretation for each wire and for each box.
In particular, **tensor-valued functors** evaluate a diagram as a tensor network using [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [TensorNetwork](https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork) or [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

Applied to pregroup diagrams, DisCoPy implements the
**categorical compositional distributional** (_DisCoCat_) models of
[Clark, Coecke, Sadrzadeh (2008)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.363.8703&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

```python
from discopy.cat import Category
from discopy.grammar import pregroup
from discopy.tensor import Dim, Tensor

F = pregroup.Functor(
    ob={s: 1, n: 2},
    ar={Alice: [1, 0], loves: [[0, 1], [1, 0]], Bob: [0, 1]},
    cod=Category(Dim, Tensor))

assert F(sentence)
```

**Diagram-valued functors** can fill each box with a complex diagram.
The result can then be simplified using `diagram.normalize()` to remove the snakes, this is called [autonomisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3827).

```python
from discopy.grammar.pregroup import Cap, Box

def wiring(word):
    if word.cod == n:  # word is a noun
        return word
    if word.cod == n.r @ s @ n.l:  # word is a transitive verb
        box = Box(word.name, n @ n, s)
        return Cap(n.r, n) @ Cap(n, n.l) >> n.r @ box @ n.l

W = pregroup.Functor(ob={s: s, n: n}, ar=wiring)

rewrite_steps = W(sentence).normalize()
sentence.to_gif(*rewrite_steps)
```

## Geometry of Chatbot Interaction

### From states to processes

The [`Int`](https://docs.discopy.org/en/main/_api/discopy.interaction.Int.html)-construction of [Joyal, Street & Verity (1996)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0305004100074338) is

> a glorification of the construction of the integers from the natural numbers

i.e. the same way we can freely add inverses to a commutative monoid to get a group, e.g. $\mathbb{N} \hookrightarrow Int(\mathbb{N}) = \mathbb{Z}$ where

$$
Int(M)Â \ = \ (M \times M) \ / \ \set{ (x, x') \sim (y, y') \ \vert \ x + y' = x' + y }
$$

you can freely add cups and caps to a [`symmetric`](https://docs.discopy.org/en/main/_api/discopy.symmetric.html) or [`balanced`](https://docs.discopy.org/en/main/_api/discopy.balanced.html) category to get a [`compact`](https://docs.discopy.org/en/main/_api/discopy.compact.html) or [`tortile`](https://docs.discopy.org/en/main/_api/discopy.tortile.html) category.

The only condition is that the monoid needs to be **cancellative**, i.e. $x + n = y + n \implies x = y$.

The [vertical categorification](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/vertical+categorification) of a cancellative monoid is called a [`traced`](https://docs.discopy.org/en/main/_api/discopy.traced.html) category, where the diagrams can have feedback loops:

![right trace](https://github.com/discopy/discopy/blob/97c002fa8eaefefc53287d960a54ebd5ac96dedd/docs/_static/traced/right-trace.png)

Given a traced category $C$, we construct $Int(C)$ with objects given by pairs of objects $Ob(Int(C)) = Ob(C) \times Ob(C)$, arrows given by $Int(C)((x_0, x_1), (y_0, y_1)) = C(x_0 \otimes y_1, x_1 \otimes y_0)$ and the composition is given by **symmetric feedback**:

![symmetric feedback](https://github.com/discopy/discopy/blob/97c002fa8eaefefc53287d960a54ebd5ac96dedd/docs/_static/int/symmetric-feedback.png)

The structure theorem of Joyal-Street-Verity says that the embedding $C \hookrightarrow Int(C)$ is fully-faithful, i.e. we can remove all the snakes and replace all the cups and caps with feedback loops.
We can use this geometry of interaction to interpret words as processes rather than states:

```python
from discopy.interaction import Ty, Int
from discopy.compact import Ty as T, Diagram as D, Box, Category

N, S = T('N'), T('S')
A, B = Box('A', N, N), Box('B', N, N)
L = Box('L', N @ S @ N, N @ S @ N)
swaps = D.permutation((2, 1, 0), N @ S @ N)
G = pregroup.Functor(
    ob={s: Ty[T](S, S), n: Ty[T](N, N)},
    ar={Alice: A, loves: swaps >> L, Bob: B},
    cod=Int(Category(T, D)))

ALB_trace = (A @ S @ B >> L).trace(left=True).trace(left=False).foliation()

with D.hypergraph_equality:
  assert G(sentence).inside == ALB_trace

Equation(sentence.foliation(), ALB_trace, symbol="$\\mapsto$").draw()
```

![Alice loves traces](https://github.com/discopy/discopy/raw/interaction-readme/docs/_static/int/alice-loves-traces.png)

### Streams and delayed feedback

A key axiom of traced monoidal categories which allows to simplify diagrams is the **yanking equation**:

![yanking](https://github.com/discopy/discopy/raw/interaction-readme/docs/_static/traced/yanking.png)

If we relax this assumption we get the concept of a [`feedback`](https://docs.discopy.org/en/main/_api/discopy.feedback.html) category where the objects come with a [`delay`](https://docs.discopy.org/en/main/_api/discopy.feedback.Ob.html#discopy.feedback.Ob.delay) operation and the feedback loops have a more restricted shape:

![feedback operator](https://github.com/discopy/discopy/raw/interaction-readme/docs/_static/feedback/feedback-operator.png)

Given a symmetric category $C$, we can construct a feedback category of **monoidal streams** $Stream(C)$ where

- the objects are infinite sequences of objects $Ob(Stream(C)) = C \times Ob(Stream(C))$,
- the arrows are infinite sequences of arrows $Stream(C)(X, Y) = \coprod_{M} Stream(C)(X, Y, M)$ defined by:

$$Stream(C)(X, Y, M) = C(X_0 \otimes M_0, Y_0 \otimes M_1)  \times Stream(C)(X^+, Y^+, M^+)$$

where $X_0$ and $X^+$ are the head and the tail of the stream $X$.

This comes with a delay $d(X) \in Ob(Stream(C))$ given by the monoidal unit as head $d(X)_0 = I$ and the given object as tail $d(X)^+ = X$.
The feedback operation is given by:

![feedback unrolling](https://github.com/discopy/discopy/raw/interaction-readme/docs/_static/stream/feedback-unrolling.png)

We can use this to unroll our diagram of the previous section:

```python
from discopy.stream import Ty, Stream

N, S = Ty("N"), Ty("S")
A, B = [Stream.sequence(f, N, N) for f in "AB"]
L = Stream.sequence('L', S.head @ N.delay() @ N.delay(), N @ N)
ALB = (L >> A @ B).feedback(dom=S.head, cod=Ty(), mem=N @ N)
ALB.unroll(2).now.foliation().draw()
```

![Alice loves unrolling](https://github.com/discopy/discopy/raw/interaction-readme/docs/_static/stream/alice-loves-unrolling.png)

Now if we use the [`python`](https://docs.discopy.org/en/main/_api/discopy.python.html) module to interpret each box as a call to a chatbot with the prompt as input, we can get an output along the following lines:

> The play is set in a basement with computers everywhere, Alice and Bob are dressed like hackers with black hoodies and nerdy glasses, they have somewhat of a hipster vibe.
> 
> Alice: I think Iâve cracked the encryption, but itâs like nothing Iâve seen before. DisCoPy â itâs almost...alive.  
> 
> Bob: What do you mean, alive? Youâre not saying itâs AI, are you? Because if it is, weâre in way over our heads.
> 
> Alice: Itâs not just AI, Bob. Itâs adaptive, learningâlike it knows weâre here.
> 
> (Bob takes a step back, his face serious as he considers the implications. He glances at the screens around them, suddenly aware of their presence.)
> 
> Bob: If thatâs true, weâre not just hacking into the system. Weâre waking it up. And if it wakes up angry...
> 
> Alice: Then weâre the ones who let it loose.
> 
> Bob: We need to find the off switch. Now. Before it finds us.
> 
> SILENCE
